Hey, I am ماہ نور (Mah Noor)!

I am a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at [Tulane University](https://sse.tulane.edu/cs), working under the supervision of Dr. [Saad Hassan](https://saadh.info/). My research lies at the intersection of Human–Computer Interaction and Artificial Intelligence, with applications in accessibility and the public sector. I am particularly interested in designing and studying interactive systems that use AI to enhance inclusivity and reduce barriers in civic processes.

My current work focuses on informing the design guidelines of dashboarding tools for more effective accessibility barrier reporting, tracking, and resolution.
