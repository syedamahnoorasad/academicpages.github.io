Governments worldwide are increasingly adopting artificial intelligence (AI) to improve efficiency, transparency, and accountability in civic operations and public services. Applications include predictive waste management, biometric identification, and decision-support systems in criminal justice. While these technologies can enhance oversight and service delivery, they also risk reinforcing systemic biases, infringing on privacy, and marginalizing vulnerable communities.  

This workshop advances Responsible AI (RAI) as a framework to mitigate such risks, emphasizing fairness, equity, and participatory approaches. Key themes include raising awareness of AIâ€™s societal impacts, improving access to auditing tools, fostering early community engagement, and ensuring inclusive participation in AI development. The program featured two keynotes, short paper sessions, and discussion-driven activities aimed at building strategies for designing community-engaged RAI systems that both maximize benefits and minimize harms in the public sector.
