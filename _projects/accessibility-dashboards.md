This project explores how civic organizations and disability communities can better disseminate data about accessibility barriers such as broken sidewalks, missing ramps, or faulty elevators. Through interviews with organization members and people with disabilities, followed by participatory design sessions using dashboard prototypes, we examined the challenges of fragmented records, inconsistent tracking mechanisms, and inaccessible systems.

Our findings highlight the need for dashboards that organize scattered data into usable views and incorporate AI responsibly for summarization and prioritization while avoiding hallucinations. The design guidelines emerging from this work emphasize practical accountability features, accessibility-first layouts, and participatory approaches that make dashboards usable tools for both everyday navigation and long-term advocacy. -->
